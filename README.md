To ever whoever read this,

I am interested in Programming, Cryptography and hacking. 

This is all my part of my journey. 

I am going through the book the Cracking Codes with Python by Al Sweigart.

I am posting the scripts there, not to steal from his work as I am giving him the credit, but for me to easily have the code available, so I can learn how to 
incrypt and decrypt in Python and learn about cryptrography more broadly. 

Thanks
